# Dizzy
A Custom android runtime for The Battle Cats By PONOS.

It's designed to run the x86_64 version of The Battle Cats with near-native performance on a linux system.

Currently it's in production (it may take weeks to release or maybe just days or hours, it depends on how fast it can be done)

Code will probably be bad.
